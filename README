The ComicPress Manager plugin works in conjunction with an installation of ComicPress,
the Webcomic theme for WordPress. ComicPress Manager is intended to reduce the amount
of work required to administer a site running ComicPress.

This is the 1.5 line. All new development and cleanup work should go here.

PHPUnit and MockPress (http://github.com/johnbintz/mockpress/tree/master) are
required to build and run the unit tests.
